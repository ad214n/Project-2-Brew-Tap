This is a full stack application that will allow the user to monitor their profile, and allow them to veiw breweries from around the country.  Each Brewery can create their own library of beers for users to browse.  

This application lacks security so in order for it to become a useful tool, I need to add some login functionality, as well as limitations for the users vs admin powers to the brewery for their own brewery.  

Brew tap contains 3 RESTful routes including one which is embedded.
The models are as followed

User Model

Brewery Model ---> Beer Model

This is a list of the technologies used in this application

    * HTML5
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
    * MongoDB.js
    * Mongoose

I took a code first, style later approach to make sure the functionality of the website was in place before the styling came.  As far as styling, I wanted to use raw CSS for this project without the help of outside libraries.  I would like to continue to add more styling and layout to this project in the future while maintaining the current routes in place.  The only thing I'd like to add to the functionality is authentication and admin permissions.
